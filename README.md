## DOCKER

You can also run in a docker without installing node or any other application (**requires docker**)

## Run development in a docker container

To run in a docker container simply run from the project folder console
```
docker-compose run --name myapp -p 3000:3000 -p 24678:24678 --rm app bash
//then
npm run dev
```
At the first run it will build the container and install all dependencies.

#### Add new packages 
If you want to add any other package from the container console then

`npm i __package__`


#### Access docker console from another terminal

`docker exec -it _container_name /bin/bash`
